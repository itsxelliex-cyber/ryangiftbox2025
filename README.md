This was made for Ryan as part of Hack Club's Giftbox event for Christmas! 

I made a 2D Platformer game on Godot, and it was my first time using this programming language!
Through this, I learned that Godot is so fun and surprisingly simple to use, and I can't wait to create more projects using this coding language! (It was hard to get the hang of it first, of course)

Music not by me! It is by Narpy
Images are also not by me! They were found on Google images

You can access the game here: https://itsxelliex-cyber.itch.io/lwinter-lofi-game 

Hope you enjoy, happy holidays!
