This was made for Ryan as part of Hack Club's Giftbox event for Christmas! 

I made a 2D Platformer game on Godot, and it was my first time using this programming language!
Through this, I learned that Godot is so fun and surprisingly simple to use, and I can't wait to create more projects using this coding language! (It was hard to get the hang of it first, of course)

You can access the game here: https://itsxelliex-cyber.itch.io/lwinter-lofi-game 

Hope you enjoy, happy holidays!
